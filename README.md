### Design Summary
The aim of this website's design is to make the customer feel like this band is fun and lighthearted whilst also being professional and easy to work with. This influenced both the colour scheme chosen for the website and the layout which are described below.

### Colour Scheme
Colormind.io was used to generate the colorscheme for this website. A key color that was included in this was the hex value #FFDB58 which is the mustard colour. This 'mustard' tone colour linked the website's design to the band's name and branding. 

The warm colors were chosen to give the user a sense of this being a friendly and fun band who are good to work with and who can generate a positive atmosphere when performing at a party/event.

The following is a screenshot of the colour scheme chosen however, due to accessibility issues with text/background, #BB4F78 was changed to a darker shade of maroon: #8C3657.

<img src="readme-docs/color-scheme.png" alt="A screenshot of colormind.io and the colors chosen for the site.">

### Fonts
The fonts chosen for the website were Anton for headings and Commissioner for the main bodies of text on the website. Each of these were imported using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans-serif was chosen as the back-up font - in case these fonts don't load - because of it's clear readability.

### Page layout
The whole site has a clear, and easy-to-use layout with a logo/home page link in the top left and navigation bar in the top right of the page. Each page has a footer with social media links. Every anchor element that the developer has coded lights up or changes colour when hovered over or tapped to help the user feel that the site responds to their actions.

### Wireframes

The wireframes below were created using [figma](https://www.figma.com/). The layout for each of the pages has been designed to suit mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### Testing user stories
### Bugs

| Bug Description  | Action Taken to Fix  |
|---|---|
| When homepage is viewed on mobile screen flipped sideways, the logo and quote spill into the nav element. | Add a min-heigh style rule to the hero image element. |
| When viewing home page on a sideways-mobile screen, the homepage nav element spills into the footer | Add a min-height style rule to the parent element of the navigation elements.|
| When viewing the contact page in Firefox the textarea overflows the form element horizontally.| Add a max-width rule of 265px targeting the textarea element.|
| When viewing the about/media/reviews/contact page on amiresponsive navbar text would wrap. | Create a media query for screens under a width of 320px to adjust size and positioning of navbar text to avoid potential breaking of page on unexpectedly small screen.|

### Known Bugs

On Google Chrome on the Huawei PSmart 2019 (EMUI android) device, the drop-down searchbar from the browser causes fixed backgrounds to move up and down occasionally which can be distracting when scrolling down the home page, review page, and contact page. 

Since the bug has a very limited impact on the user's ability to use the site and will only affect a subset of users, this bug was not addressed given the time limitations of the developer for this project.

## Credits
* The 404 page was created with the help of GitHub's [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site) on how to create a custom 404 page.

### 3rd party code used
* Google Fonts.
* Fontawesome Characters.
* The embedded soundcloud player was copied from Soundcloud.com (https://soundcloud.com/andrew-silk-743237145/isnt-she-lovely).

        <img src="readme-docs/soundcloud-embed.png" alt="A screenshot of the soundclound share modal with the embed tab highlighted."><br>

        <img src="readme-docs/soundcloud-iframe.png" alt="A screenshot of the soundclound share modal with the iframe code snippet highlighted."><br>
    
    - I deleted the allow="autoplay" attributes as well as the obsolete inline CSS in the iframe element, and added aria labels to the extra soundcloud links that appear in the code.

    - I also moved the inline CSS in the anchor elements nested in the iframe to the style.css file.

### Media

* The following images (which are not of the band) were found:
    1. Durham Castle at night time: [Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Keep_and_Gatehouse_of_Durham_Castle_at_night.jpg )
