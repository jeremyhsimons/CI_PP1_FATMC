## Design
### Design Summary
The aim of this website's design is to make the customer feel like this band is fun and lighthearted whilst also being professional and easy to work with. This influenced both the colour scheme chosen for the website and the layout which are described below.

### Colour Scheme
Colormind.io was used to generate the colorscheme for this website. A key color that was included in this was the hex value #FFDB58 which is the mustard colour. This 'mustard' tone colour linked the website's design to the band's name and branding. 

The warm colors were chosen to give the user a sense of this being a friendly and fun band who are good to work with and who can generate a positive atmosphere when performing at a party/event.

The following is a screenshot of the colour scheme chosen however, due to accessibility issues with text/background, #BB4F78 was changed to a darker shade of maroon: #8C3657.
